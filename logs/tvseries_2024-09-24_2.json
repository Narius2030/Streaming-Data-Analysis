The show also originally and currently focuses on the Stewart family. During the early 2000s, the central storylines focused on the Sutherlands and later, the Hunters. Home and Away had proved popular when it premiered in 1988 and had risen to become a hit in Australia, and after only a few weeks, the show tackled its first major and disturbing storyline, the rape of Carly Morris; it was one of the first shows to feature such storylines during the early timeslot. H&A has tackled many adult-themed and controversial storylines; something rarely found in its restricted timeslot.",

After losing her parents as a kid, she travels around the country with tinker Yong Jangwon and grows up as a strong woman full of courage.

Meanwhile, there is Yeo Uiju, a man who gets on her nerves by loafing around her. As a soldier, he is more logical rather than empathetic, but he passes out whenever he gets drunk. He loses his face after meeting Sujeong, who drinks like a fish, but he starts to fall for her. By a twist of fate, he realizes he is the second grandson of Masung Group, and his older brother is Sujeong's crush, Ujin.",
